# react-tailwind-landing-page

Nov 10 2022
-starting a landing page for tutoring service or portfolio. after using npm, react, etc. in various tutorials and projects. i never really undertood what was going on at a high level. I jumped straight into code and left it at that. I definitely learned alot about implementation. But my building skills, e.g. doing a project, was limited because of the lack of high level knowledge. By high level, we mean more overview and less detail/code.

    Use npx to create-react-app first. It seems like react doesn't need to be installed first. npx will do it's thing. After the create-react-app project is created, go into the project folder and install Tailwind using the tutorial. Left off finishing step 2 of the tutorial.
